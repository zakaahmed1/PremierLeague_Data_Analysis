# PremierLeague_Data_Analysis
A series of Python projects performing data analysis on a large dataset of Premier League player statistics.

premier_league_player_stats.csv is a csv file containing statistical data about active Premier League footballers. I perform data analysis on the dataset in the following three projects:

Simple_Data_Analysis.py : I perform some simple data analysis using the in-built csv reader \n
Plotting_Graphs.py : I plot two charts, a bar chart showing the top 10 Premier League goalscorers, and a pie chart showing the distribution of player's positions \n
Dataframes_Premier_League_Stats.py : To summarise the dataset in a neat and elegant manner, we finally create a dataframe which will allow us to perform calculations to find out any trends we wish to uncover
